# T1Engine

Basic 3D Fixed-Rendering Pipeline Engine built in C++ using OpenGL and Glut

- Includes custom working OBJ Loader with working illumination/normals, texturing and proper sub-object grouping
- Complete scene management implemented - basic state management
- Simple 3D Collisions (sphere-sphere)
- Efficent in terms of memory and processing power
- Skyboxes & Skyspheres
- Built in 3 weeks as a final project (excl. OBJ loader)
- Basic DEM terrain system implemented with polygon normals

Basic engine that I built for my introduction to 3d graphics course (Virtual and Interactive Computing) as a final project from scratch. Most of the time was spent building scenes, and earlier in the course creating the OBJ loader. Basic, and doesn't use shaders - but still serves as a pretty nice baseline for fixed-rendering with OpenGL.

Below are some screenshots of basic scenes built to showcase the engine. Keep in mind that this was built as a final project for a class while taking 3 other classes and with a deadline of 3 or so weeks.
