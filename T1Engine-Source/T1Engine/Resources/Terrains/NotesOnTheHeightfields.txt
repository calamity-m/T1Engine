These plain text heigtfields were created in 1998 by Robert Cox and Paul Bavinton using a delphi program that was an erosion model inspired by the idea that rivers are in fact a form of hebbian leraning (which is actually rather silly).

Much to the suprise of their creators they have ben very usefull as a teaching tool for 3d graphics subjects at the university of canberra

The X22_ series (180 by 180) had a model that assumed the ocean was of constant height hence all ocean heights are -1

The X20_ series (102 by 102) had a model that assumed sea level rise hence they have underwater features 

The X21_ series (various sizes) are fabrications from excel for teaching and testing purposes (some are subsets of the X20 series).

They are officially released into the public domain in 2015 though in truth they have been avaiailable on public web sites since 2005 

Hope You find them usefull.
